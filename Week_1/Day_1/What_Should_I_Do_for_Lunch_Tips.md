### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators ('<', '>, '===', etc.) in the node REPL, which can be launched with the 'node' command in Vagrant

Work on code iteratively - meaning in small pieces

To help figure out how to use 'hungry' and 'availableTime' inside the function, try outputting their values in terminal as follows:

```
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry,availableTime) {
  console.log("hunger is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}

```
